  `I am a frontend designer-developer with over 4 years of professional experience building enterprise-grade dynamic web apps using TypeScript, Vue, and Less CSS.`,
  `To demonstrate my ability to quickly learn new technologies, I chose to build this website with React, Styled Components, and Tailwind CSS.
  Regardless of the tech stack you are currently using, I am confident that I can quickly become a productive member of the Capito team.`,
  `Capito's mission of improving information accessibility resonates with me very strongly, as I find that there is no shortage of information in
  the world, but unfortunately most of it is illegible most people, this limits our ability to grow as a society.`,
  `In addition to the positive social impact of the product, I am also very impressed by your thoughtful and considerate employment policies.
  All together, it seems like a really great place to work, and I would love to join your team!`,
