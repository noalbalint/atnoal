  `I am a frontend designer-developer with over 4 years of professional experience building enterprise-grade dynamic web apps using TypeScript, Vue, and Less CSS.`,
  `To demonstrate my ability to quickly learn new technologies, I chose to build this application with React, Styled Components, and Tailwind CSS.
  Regardless of the tech stack you are currently using, I am confident that I can quickly become a productive member of your team.`,
  `As global attention spans continue to shrink, people are losing their ability to consume complicated, long-form content. This is
  an existential threat to a healthy, educated society. Capito's ability to make high-quality information more accessible may hold the key to fixing this.`,
  `Zeit ist wertvoll sicher, and I would be very happy to spend my working hours on this high-impact project. Please consider me for any future openings that may arise!`,
